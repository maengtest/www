<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<dl>
  <dt>What is a Customs Broker?</dt>
  <dd>Licensed by Professional Regulation Commission and the Bureau of Customs, a customs broker may act as an agent for commercial businesses importing product to Philippines. In order for a shipment to be released by Philippine Customs and other government bodies, such as Department of Agriculture or the Department of Transportation and Communication, all required documents and forms must be supplied to them. A H.S. Tariff classification number must be applied to each product imported. This code determines the rate of duties and taxes that must be paid to Customs Philippines. With all the changing rules and regulations in cross-border transactions, is makes good business sense to use a Customs Broker.
  </dd>

  <dt>What does it cost to use a Customs Broker?</dt>
  <dd>A brokerage fee is usually determined by the total value of the shipment being imported. In some cases, a set rate or fee is agreed upon between the broker and client. <a href="mailto:info@gaacbrokerage.com">Talk to us now for best rates</a>.
  </dd>

  <dt>What paperwork is required?</dt>

  </dd>
  
  <dt>Clearance of my merchandise: What do I need?</dt>
  <dd><b>GAAC Customs Brokerage</b> requires the following, at a minimum, in order to prepare an entry:
    <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Commercial Invoice</b> - Preferably in English, which describes the product, terms of sale, and the purchase price FOB origin port. If the product originates in a country other than the one you purchase from, the actual country of origin of the merchandise should appear somewhere on the invoice. The name of the seller and the buyer and the currency of purchase should be clearly stated. Some importers think that they should include as little information as possible in the invoices they provide to their Customs Broker. This works against you! When we can't get enough information to substantiate a lower duty classification on merchandise, we are required to use the higher classification. So, give your Customs Broker enough information to do the job properly.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Bill of Lading or Air Waybill</b> - This is the transport document that covered the movement from origin to the port of entry.
        </li>

         <li>
          <b>Country of Origin Marking</b> - One of the most common problems that will hold up an entry is when the product or merchandise does not have any marking which indicates its origin. "Origin" does not necessarily mean where you bought it. "Origin" should be discussed with your Customs Broker so that you understand the term as it relates to Customs. Marking requirements are clearly stated in the regulations and we at <b>GAAC Customs Brokerage</b> can be a valuable asset in determining what you must do. <a href="mailto:info@gaacbrokerage.com">Talk to us now for further guidance</a>.
         </li>

         <li>
          <b>Other regulatory agencies</b> - Some products are also subject to approval by other agencies of the Philippine Government before entry is approved. Among these are: Bureau of Food and Drugs (BFAD), Department of Agriculture (DAR), Department of Transportation and Communication (DOTC), Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), and others. Discuss this with us at <b>GAAC Customs Brokerage</b> as we can coordinate entry with these agencies as part of our service. Do not delay, <a href="mailto:info@gaacbrokerage.com">talk to us now</a>.
         </li>

         <li>
         How long does it take? - After the first few entries, where Customs may take a little extra time to become familiar with your company and the products you import, the usual time for clearance can be a short as a few hours up to 2-3 days. Perishables are usually cleared immediately.
         </li>

         <li>
         Your Cooperation - The Customs Broker is a professional that wants to do the best job for you, our Client.
